# NASA Europa UV Analysis For Students

This repository contains materials for the NASA Europa UV spectral analysis workshop.

## Repository Contents

- `student_guide.md`: A comprehensive guide covering Europa science, how to access HST data from MAST, and background on the specific HST observations used in this workshop.
- `europa_uv_tutorial.py`: A tutorial script demonstrating how to work with UV spectral data from the Hubble Space Telescope.
- `data/`: Directory containing HST observation data files (FITS format).

## Getting Started

1. Read through the `student_guide.md` file to understand the science background and data sources.
2. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
   ```
   pip install astropy astroquery numpy matplotlib pandas
   ```
3. Work through the `europa_uv_tutorial.py` tutorial file to learn how to analyze Europa UV spectra.

## Student Tasks

After completing the tutorial:
1. Familiarize yourself with the MAST observation platform
2. Apply the analysis techniques you've learned to real HST data
3. Interpret the results in the context of Europa's atmospheric composition and interaction with Jupiter's magnetic field

## Data Sources

The UV spectra here come from HST Proposal 8224, "UV Imaging of Europa & Ganymede: Unveiling Satellite Aurora & Electrodynamical Interactions," led by Principal Investigator Melissa A. McGrath (NASA/MSFC).
